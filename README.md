# AES Test
AES Test

Adapted from http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Security/AES/AES_v1.html <BR>
This program generates a AES key, retrieves its raw bytes, and then reinstantiates a AES key from the key bytes. <BR>
The reinstantiated key is used to initialize a AES cipher for encryption and decryption. <BR>

# Test it
```
java -jar AES.jar your_string
```
